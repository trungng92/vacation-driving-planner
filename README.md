# Summary

This is a tool to help plan driving trips when you have drivers coming from different cities.

The basic idea is that you can put in a list of starting cities, and this will calculate the driving distances of major cities and filter out major cities that are not within driving distances of all the starting cities.

You will also be able to specify other filters as well.
